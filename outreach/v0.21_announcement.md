# Announcing rodio 0.21

Rodio is an audio playback library. It can decode audio files, synthesize new
sounds, apply effects to sounds & mix them. Rodio has been part of the Rust
ecosystem for 9 years now! ðŸŽ‰.

## New release
It's been 8 months since our last release. Since then our team has grown to 3
maintainers! Thank you Petr and Roderick! And a big thanks for the countless
other contributors helping out. Thanks to you all this release:

- Makes the API easier to use:
    - We now warn when audio could be stopped without the dev intending.
    - Our types are no longer generic over sample type.
    - The features have been overhauled and we now have better defaults.
- Adds new functionality:
    - Many rodio parts such as the decoder and outputstream are now easily 
      configurable using builders.
    - Amplify using decibels or perceptually.
    - A distortion effect.
    - A limiter.
    - Many more noise generators
- You can use rodio without `cpal` to analyze audio or generate `wav` files! 

There have also been many fixes and smaller additions, take a look at the full
[changelog](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)!

## Breaking changes
As we made quite a few breaking changes we now have an [upgrade guide](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio/blob/master/UPGRADE.md)!

## The future
The rust audio organization will keep working on audio in Rust. We hope to
release an announcement regarding that soon!
